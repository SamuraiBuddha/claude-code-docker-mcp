# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Contact Information
- **Primary Contact:** Jordan Ehrig - jordan@ehrig.dev
- **Response Time:** Within 24 hours for critical issues
- **Secure Communication:** Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting

## Vulnerability Handling

### Severity Levels
- **Critical:** Remote code execution, container escape, data breach potential
- **High:** Privilege escalation, authentication bypass, secret exposure
- **Medium:** Information disclosure, denial of service, resource exhaustion
- **Low:** Minor issues with limited impact

### Response Timeline
- **Critical:** 24 hours
- **High:** 72 hours  
- **Medium:** 1 week
- **Low:** 2 weeks

## Security Measures

### Container Security
- Non-root user execution
- Limited capabilities (no-new-privileges)
- Read-only root filesystem where possible
- Resource limits enforced
- Network isolation

### API Security
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS policy enforcement
- Helmet security headers
- Request size limits

### Secret Management
- Environment variable injection only
- No secrets in container images
- Secret rotation schedules maintained
- Access logging and monitoring

### Infrastructure Security
- Container registry scanning
- Base image security updates
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Network segmentation

## Incident Response Plan

### Detection
1. **Automated:** Security scanning alerts
2. **Manual:** User reports, code review findings
3. **Monitoring:** Anomalous behavior detection

### Response
1. **Assess:** Determine severity and impact
2. **Contain:** Isolate affected systems
3. **Investigate:** Root cause analysis
4. **Remediate:** Apply fixes and patches
5. **Recover:** Restore normal operations
6. **Learn:** Post-incident review and improvements

### Communication
- **Internal:** Team notification within 1 hour
- **Users:** Status page updates for outages
- **Public:** Disclosure after remediation (if required)

## Security Audits

### Regular Security Reviews
- **Code Review:** Every pull request
- **Dependency Scan:** Weekly automated scans
- **Container Scan:** On every build
- **Penetration Test:** Quarterly (if warranted)

### Last Security Audit
- **Date:** 2025-07-03 (Initial setup)
- **Scope:** Architecture review and security template deployment
- **Findings:** No issues - initial secure configuration
- **Next Review:** 2025-10-01
